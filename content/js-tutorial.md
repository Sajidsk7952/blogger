## 1. Getting Started
To get started with JavaScript, you need to include it in your HTML file. You can do this by using the `<script>` tag.

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>JavaScript Tutorial</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>Hello, JavaScript!</h1>
    <script>
        console.log('Hello, JavaScript!');
    </script>
</body>
</html>
```
## variables and Data types
JavaScript supports various data types including numbers, strings, and booleans. You can declare variables using var, let, or const.
let name = 'John';
const age = 30;
var isDeveloper = true;

console.log(name); // John
console.log(age); // 30
console.log(isDeveloper); // true
